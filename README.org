* cl-webgpu

Common Lisp bindings to WebGPU (via [[https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native][wgpu-native]]) (WIP)

High-level bindings are in the ~webgpu~ package (currently only supports Linux
and X11). They're pretty much unusable at this point.

Low-level bindings are in the ~webgpu.ffi~ package (auto generated using
~cffi/c2ffi~) and should be usable.

** Setup

Currently expects ~libwgpu_native.so~ to be available in the system (e.g. in
~/usr/lib~ for Linux).
